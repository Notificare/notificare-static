		<h2>A single composer or API endpoint</h2>
		<p>
			Our unique approach to the unified message paradigm will deliver notifications to iOS and Android apps or websites. 
			Despite these platforms (Apple Push Notification Service, Google Cloud Messaging and HTML5 WebSockets) all having different characteristics and capabilities, 
			Notificare allows you to communicate with your users in a shared message composer or a single API endpoint request.

		<h2>Most native &amp; customizable UI</h2>
		<p>
			By using our SDK libraries you will no longer need to spend development time in creating custom solutions for every type of message you want to send. 
			All of that is been taken care of by using the most native approach possible, according to the platform's standards and capabilities. 
			You can even customize elements to fit your application look and feel.
