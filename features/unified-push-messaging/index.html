                All the data we gather for you will give you a pretty clear picture about your app's performance.
                How fragmented is your app? What about operating systems, devices or user language?
                We've already addressed all these questions by providing you with one central place for all these insights.

                Our unique approach to the unified message paradigm will deliver notifications to iOS and Android apps or websites.
                Despite all these platforms (Apple Push Notification Service, Google Cloud Messaging and HTML5 WebSockets) have different characteristics and capabilities,
                Notificare allows you to communicate with your users in a shared message composer or a single API endpoint request.

                By using our SDK libraries you will no longer need to spend development time in creating custom solutions for every type of message you want to send.
                All of that is been taken care of by using the most native approach possible, according to the platform's standards and capabilities.
                You can even customize elements to fit your application look and feel.
