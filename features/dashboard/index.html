                Add as many applications as you need, all with their own collection of devices and user profiles.
                It's easy to keep development, acceptance and production separate by creating different applications for each of them.
                Applications can be selected from a searchable drop-down menu that's accessible from anywhere in the dashboard.

                Upload your certificates for APNS and we take care of validating them and keeping track of expiration.
                Add your app ID in the AppStore, so we can direct your users to rating your app right from a push notification.
