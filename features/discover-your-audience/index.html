		<h2>Personalized user experience.</h2>
		<p>
			Easily create a minimal user profile by mapping your user to websites like Facebook, Twitter, Gravatar or even your own existing authentication method. 
			Profiles are our answer to a more personalized messaging experience. 
			By creating a user profile your app is allowing Notificare to associate more than one device with a user. 
			Not only can you send targeted messages to a particular user, you can now also single out their devices.
