		<h2>Personalized user experience.</h2>
		<p>
			Easily create a minimal user profile by mapping your user to websites like Facebook, Twitter, Gravatar or even your own existing authentication method. 
			Profiles are our answer to a more personalized messaging experience. 
			By creating a user profile your app is allowing Notificare to associate more than one device with a user. 
			Not only can you send targeted messages to a particular user, you can now also single out their devices.

		<h2>Segment your audience</h2>
		<p>
			Categorizing your users is important to keep a sane structure in how you target your audience. 
			Segments and tags can be combined with geo-location and provide your app with a complex segmented query that will cover most of the cases you will ever think of. 
			Grouping your customers, not only by the devices they are using but also based on their whereabouts, has never been this easy.
