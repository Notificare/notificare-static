		<h2>Geo-Targeting</h2>
		<p>
			We made it extremely simple for your apps to use customers' location for categorizing and sending targeted messages that are both relevant and effective. Make a fine-grained selection of your target audience in specific neighborhoods. Learn and categorize your users by the places where they live or work. Easily search and select any position on the globe, define a radius and send rich and interactive messages that reach your customers exactly where they are.

		<h2>Geo-Fencing</h2>
		<p>
			With our SDK your app will be able to take advantage of the best functionality mobile platforms can offer. Remember, your users are on the move and we can give your application the power to reach them when the context is right. It has never been this easy to send rich and interactive content when your users enter or leave a certain area. Greet your customers, give them special offers or simply categorize them. A powerful solution any industry can benefit from.

		<h2>Micro-location &amp; content advertising</h2>
		<p>
			With the ever-increasing number of personal connected devices like smart watches and fitness bands, which require mobile devices to be Bluetooth-enabled, we provide you with solutions to harness yet another channel. Using Notificare Bluetooth low energy beacons, your app can now gather information or present content when your customers are physically in your store or venue. Detect their proximity to display more information about the product they are looking at, either on their devices or on additional screens.
