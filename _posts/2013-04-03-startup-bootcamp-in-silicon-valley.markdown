We are proud to be part of Netherlandsâ€™ Most Promising Start-ups that got invited to experience Silicon Valley first-hand.

The Holland in the (V)Alley Startup Bootcamp is a 4-day intensive program organized by the Consulate General of the Netherlands in San Francisco and New York. A panel of experts, including serial entrepreneurs, venture capital investors, and Silicon Valley business leaders, have selected 15 Dutch startups to participate in Silicon Valley and 8 in New York for the 5th Annual Startup Bootcamp. The program offers companies the tools they need to succeed in Silicon (V)Alley and similar thriving business communities. The Startup Bootcamp is designed to provide a first-hand experience of the Silicon Valley / Silicon Alley ecosystems. The program includes workshops and roundtable discussions with industry experts, individual sessions to address and discuss specific topics, and visits with key players in Silicon Valley and New York. Our flagship event, Dutch Demo Night, is the grand finale on the 6th of June. During this event, participants take the floor for 3-minute pitches presented before a panel of experts.
