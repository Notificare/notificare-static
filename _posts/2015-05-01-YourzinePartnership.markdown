**Press release** Yourzine, a trendsetting dialogue marketing bureau in the Netherlands, announces its new strategic partnership with Notificare today. Notificare is a mobile marketing platform that allows marketeers to send context-relevant and interactive notifications to smartphones and tablets.

Mobile is an interesting challenge for marketeers, particularly in view of the overwhelming number of possibilities offered via mobile devices and the current addition of smartwatches. With the use of Notificare and iBeacon technology, companies now are able, after permission is obtained from customers, to collect information about them, for example also registering when they are physically present in the shop. This information gives marketeers better insight into the products that consumers are looking for. Retailers can then send special offers to users of their app when they are near a store location, for example. This contributes to creating better customer experiences and makes a connection between online and offline.

“At Yourzine we see that brands and organizations are increasingly dealing with existing and potential clients who are integrating various mobile devices into their daily life,” says Michiel van Riemsdijk, director of Yourzine. “That’s why it’s important to add the mobile channel to the omni-channel strategy. Thanks to our partnership with Notificare we can go a step farther and help our clients get the most out of their apps. We can now reach the end user with relevant messages at home or on the road, regardless of what device they are using, to increase the value for the client.”

Robert Leefmans, CEO at Notificare adds: “Consumers are always on the move and often fall off the radar of the marketer. Notificare offers a solution that makes it possible to reach these people through notifications on their mobile devices, precisely when and where it is most useful for the consumer. With our technology, which is a plug-in for apps, more companies can benefit from this powerful marketing tool. We are delighted to join forces with Yourzine and so further strengthen the relation between consumer and brand.”
