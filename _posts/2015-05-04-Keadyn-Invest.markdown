**Press release** Venture builder Keadyn is investing in Notificare, the Mobile Marketing Platform. This investment will propel Notificare into its next stage of development. The company is expanding successfully and wants to accelerate its growth. In the coming period it will be expanding its team as well as its client base. Notificare believes in the power of personal and location-based interaction with customers and wants to communicate this vision to the world.

Notificare is a successful Dutch startup that was founded in 2012 by Joel Oliveira (CPO), Joris Verbogt (CTO) and Robert Leefmans (CEO). Their Mobile Marketing Platform strikes a bridge between the virtual and physical world with clever mobile technology. It makes use of smartphones, geolocation, iBeacon, and more. The young firm is developing and delivering a unique platform that enables the creation and maintenance of longterm customer relationships through push notifications. Using the profile and location of the user, interactive and contextual messages can be sent. Notificare expects the Keadyn investment to establish a more robust foundation for the growth of the company.

**Venture builder**
Keadyn is a venture builder that contributes to the acceleration of young companies through entrepreneurship. According to Keadyn owner Martijn Don, the collaboration with Notificare suits the vision of his company perfectly. “We find the technology of Notificare terrifically rich in opportunities. It supplies great added value to its clients, who can use this service to send messages to the right person and at the right moment, for example on the basis of that person’s current location. The time has now come to accelerate the company’s growth in the Netherlands and beyond. Keadyn is happy to be making a contribution to this process.”

**Retail, events, and media**
Notificare is already being employed by large clients such as the Hema, Lotto and the Netherlands Red Cross organization. The company is now ready to embark on a new stage of development thanks to the €200,000 investment from Keadyn. This is the first part of a rolling close; the next round of investments is expected to raise a total of €400,000. Various investors have shown interest already. Notificare is open to all investors who also offer actual added value, as Keadyn does. The received funds will be used among other things to achieve scale and to develop the company further on an international level.

Robert Leefmans, CEO of Notificare: “The investment marks an important moment for us. From this point forward we can give additional impetus to our growth activities. Notificare supplies a powerful marketing instrument that is proving its value in countless industries: retail, events, and media. By working together with Keadyn we now have more leverage to communicate our vision worldwide. The first steps that we are going to take are to expand our team and to bolster sales and marketing activities. 


Robert Leefmans, CEO at Notificare adds: “Consumers are always on the move and often fall off the radar of the marketer. Notificare offers a solution that makes it possible to reach these people through notifications on their mobile devices, precisely when and where it is most useful for the consumer. With our technology, which is a plug-in for apps, more companies can benefit from this powerful marketing tool. We are delighted to join forces with Yourzine and so further strengthen the relation between consumer and brand.”
