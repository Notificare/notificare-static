For me the MB Pocket Simon was a real icon in the 80's. Every time I went over to my friend Jerry we played with the Simon. Turn it on and you see a lights flashing, you hear a sound and the game starts! You need to take action, repeat the sequence and the game continues.

Now Notificare has noting to do with a game, but it is be as simple as this game. A push notification comes in and this means taking action. Simon says Notificare!
