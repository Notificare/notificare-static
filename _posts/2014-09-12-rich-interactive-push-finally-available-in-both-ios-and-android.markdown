We were thrilled when Apple announced the new remote push messages with actions in iOS 8. Since day one we made this kind of interactions our flagship feature. Already proven to be a great feature in Android, it changed the way users interact with apps, increasing engagement and loyalty. Now, both with notifications coming to the lock screen on Android L as well as these Push Actions on iOS 8, we can offer the same rich experience for all, conveniently sent from a unified composer.

### Android Wear
As announced in April, we are the first mobile marketing platform to fully support the recently launched Android operating system for wearables. Our actionable push notifications benefit from the built-in voice control of Android Wear to quickly execute any actions you use in your notifications. This is already included in our Android SDK and we can't wait for what you'll do with it.
