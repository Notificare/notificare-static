We are excited to announce that our team has moved to a new location in Amsterdam. We spent the previous year working from our office at the Startup Campus Rotterdam, which was great. We've chosen for Amsterdam to be closer to our clients and because of the possibility to stay close to Central Station.

Our new address: 
Overhoeksplein 2, 1035 KS Amsterdam
The phone numbers remain the same: 
+31854013414 (EU) and +1 (512) 774 61 27 (US)

The Notificare office is located in the new [A Lab building][alab] which is situated in the former Shell Laboratories on the north shores of the IJ in Amsterdam. A Lab is a place where start-ups and professionals meet, where multidisciplinary creatives within the fields of new media and technology find their peers and can start and house their company. â€” at A Lab.
