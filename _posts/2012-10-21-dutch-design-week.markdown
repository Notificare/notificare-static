We were invited by our friends of [The Incredible Machine](http://the-incredible-machine.com/) to contribute to their seminar at the [Dutch Design Week](http://www.ddw.nl)  in Eindhoven. If you want to join us and other interesting people, sorry, I mean individuals, in a discussion on Design and the Internet of Things, please register [here](http://thedaythedoorbellringsyou.eventbrite.nl/)
