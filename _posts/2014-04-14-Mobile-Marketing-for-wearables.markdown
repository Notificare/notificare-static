**Press release** Notificare, the Mobile Marketing Platform, is excited to announce that as of today the Notificare Android SDK fully supports Android Wear. After being the first Mobile Marketing Platform supporting iBeacon technology, it’s now the first platform supporting the new operating system for wearables out-of-the-box. Notificare’s unique technology (Push Actions) enables marketers to interact with their customers via push notification message. Until today this could only be done when using their app, now this two-way communication technology can be on your wrist.

Robert Leefmans, CEO of Notificare already announced the integration with Android Wear during the Online Tuesday event last week. „We see an enormous growth of connected devices the upcoming year. The iBeacon is a good example, but there will be more devices enabling a more personal approach. With Android Wear it’s now possible to send personal marketing messages directly to the watch. Notifications are a really important part of the new operation system and, when used right, can be more relevant for consumers than when sent to the smartphone.”

Joris Verbogt, CTO: “Since day one we envisioned a platform that would bridge the gap between the virtual world and the ever growing number of connected devices. After smart phone, tablet and web browser, now Android Wear opens up a whole new realm of wearable devices. This brings us one step closer to delivering truly relevant content to people on the device that really suits best.”

“The ability to send messages to the wrist fascinates us, but we recognize it needs to be handled with caution. With the powerful tools our platform provides, you are able to target persons very precisely; don’t make the mistake to abuse it. The consumer wants it done right and contextual. With our platform you can.”
